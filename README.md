## What is *Advent of Code*? 
From the *Advent of Code* official page: 
>Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme. 

## Why Angular?
The main goal for me is to gain some experience with `@angular/material` library.
